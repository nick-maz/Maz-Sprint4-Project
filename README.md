# Maz-Sprint4-Project

Sprint 4 Project is a web app developed using several different Python libraries to execute simple price analysis with US vehicle data. This web app is a tool to simulate random events and factors relating to vehicle data in the United States. The python libraries used were pandas, streamlit, numpy, and plotly.express. After some initial EDA in the jupyter notebook, the majority of the app was built using VS code.
